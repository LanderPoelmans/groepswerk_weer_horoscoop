# Chinese Zodiac Sign Application
Chinese Zodiac Sign Application was created as a school project by a team of 3 aspiring front-end developers: Louise Van Aerschot, Lander Poelmans and Sander Geunes.
The app, built mainly using Javascript, provides the user with its Chinese zodiac sign and element, as well as an inspiring quote. In addition, the user receives country-specific weather information thanks to a free weather API (https://www.visualcrossing.com/). 
All in all, the application is a beautiful example of a great teamwork accomplishment.
